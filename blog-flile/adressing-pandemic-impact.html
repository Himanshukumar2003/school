                        <h2>Addressing pandemic impact on children with special educational needs must be a priority in
                            India</h2>
                        <p class="mb-2">With the pandemic lasting about two years and everyone adjusting to the “new
                            normal”, many institutions experienced severe barriers and have been unable to provide the
                            same quality of output and experience as in pre-pandemic times. A lot has been written about
                            the pandemic and the impact of lockdowns on different sectors, one of the most important
                            being schools and education. The learning process and developmental years have been
                            adversely affected for countless children, as homes cannot provide a similarly stimulating
                            learning environment and focus. Several studies have mapped the serious effects of online
                            schooling on children – the number of students being a staggering 250 million, as per the
                            Observer Research Foundation. Many children were at risk of child labor and had to take up
                            odd jobs to support their families, or dropped out of school due to lack of resources and
                            digital mediums. Private, urban schools were still better off, but amidst the chaos, little
                            attention was paid to children with special needs or learning disabilities. Their progress
                            has moved many steps backward during these turbulent times.</p>
                        <p class="mb-2">It is important to note that parents may not have the skills or capabilities to
                            address the needs of children with learning disabilities. The pandemic has been tough on
                            them too, as they juggle working from home, undertaking housework, and supervising their
                            children. Just by being parents, they are not equipped or qualified to fill in the shoes of
                            special educators and therapists their children need. This results in unintentional
                            negligence and frustration, which often manifests in harsh insults or physical punishment
                            upon the child, who is already burdened and struggling.</p>
                        <p class="mb-2">Therapy classes and assistance for children with special needs have to be
                            customized and carefully planned, with methodical approaches to provide the children the
                            space they need outside of their classroom and home, to learn and express themselves. The
                            physical care, acceptance and support they needed was lost coming through the virtual
                            interface of a laptop screen. It is also technically difficult to conduct speech or
                            occupational therapy classes, for writing and comprehension, in online mode. The resources
                            and study material for them have always been limited, and it became tougher to provide the
                            same quality of teaching, as the process of explanation and new concepts felt daunting.
                            Rapid digitization of the required material was not possible or easily accessible.</p>
                        <p class="mb-2">Children are sensitive to their environment and experience a lot of stress and
                            feel overwhelmed, when trying to adapt and fulfill the deadlines of school and expectations
                            of parents. At Adhyayan Academy, many expressed that their ability to fully comprehend what
                            is taught has been impacted due to full time online classes. This was also observed at
                            Shradhanjali Integrated School, operated by the Association of People with Disabilities
                            (APD) in Lingarajapuram, Bangalore, which held a session with a UNICEF communication expert.
                            Children having cerebral palsy and other conditions, voiced their concerns about challenges
                            during the pandemic, and the widespread need for institutions and the system to increase
                            efforts in making their online education more inclusive.</p>
                        <p class="mb-2">Some students have also shown symptoms of ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
                            Disorder) over the course of the pandemic, and some parents have also expressed concern over
                            a rise of aggression and irritability in their children. The problem does not solve itself
                            with the reopening of schools, as children find the transition back to school after two
                            years online overwhelming, and have problems sitting and focusing in class for eight periods
                            straight.</p>
                        <p class="mb-2">As a way forward, it is critical that along with regular educational needs, the
                            needs of special children are not placed on low priority during a crisis. The system and key
                            stakeholders must work together and outline a targeted intervention program with a back-end
                            system. There is an urgent need to provide comprehensive tech-oriented training to special
                            educators in the field of online/hybrid teaching, which is fast becoming the new mode of
                            teaching and requires a completely different mindset for both teachers and students, to
                            focus on simultaneous learning and counseling. Skill enhancement and upgradation are a must
                            as special educators are few. These are urgent interventions that must be taken if we care
                            for our citizens of tomorrow, and with the reopening of institutions we can hope to overcome
                            these challenges through collective efforts.</p>
