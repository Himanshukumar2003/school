                        <h2>Are we ready for inclusive education?</h2>
                        <p>With the new Education Policy (NEP 2020) Indian education enters into the era of inclusive
                            education where children with disabilities will not be denied school admission under any
                            circumstanc</p>
                        <p>NEP will provide handholding to disabled children and lead them to the best schools, which
                            under no condition can say “no” to the child with disabilities to be a part of the education
                            system.</p>
                        <p>Indeed, this is a very big step towards embracing and empowering the disabled community at
                            large. The moot question here is, are we ready for it? First and foremost, are we as a
                            society intrinsically ready to welcome such a change? Tacit acceptance is easy but the
                            actual implementation is easier said than done.</p>
                        <p>Are you, as a parent, ready for your child to bring home a wheelchair-bound friend? When it
                            comes to your child being friends with differently-abled children, you might say, “They are
                            different try mixing with others.” The paradigm shift in mindset from ‘Them’ to ‘Us’ will
                            never allow inclusion to be accepted as a way of life unless addressed holistically. It is
                            the stereotypical mentality that needs to go out of the system for inclusion to flourish.
                        </p>
                        <p>Empathy, not sympathy, is needed for a disabled person. One has to empathize with the
                            condition not sympathize. The ability to step into that person’s shoes to comprehend the
                            daily challenges and pain he/she has to go through.</p>
                        <p>Transforming a societal mindset is always a challenge but being achieving a sensitive mindset
                            can be relatively easy if we are open to seeing things from a different perspective. Nazar
                            Nahi Nazariya Badliye.</p>
                        <p>Right to Person with Disability Act, 2016 (RPWD Act) covers 21 disabilities. Academic
                            institutions need to provide ramp access for wheelchair-bound students to facilitate
                            seamless access and movement within the school perimeters.</p>
                        <p>Similarly, toilets facilities and height-adjusted washbasin should be specifically earmarked
                            for such children. There are clear guidelines about accessibility and provision under
                            inclusive learning. But what about the ramp needed by society to uplift its mental make-up?
                        </p>
                        <p>Children with disabilities have demonstrated their capabilities in various Paralympics.
                            Indian Paralympians have led the way by topping medal tallies at various events. Proper
                            guidance and encouragement will ensure that all inherent mental blocks get eradicated over
                            time.</p>
                        <p>Of course, we need to provide a solid foundation to such children but before that, as a
                            society, we need to develop our mental foundations to allow inclusion. It is high time to
                            embrace and empower children with special needs.</p>
                        <p>NEP 2020 also ensures that language is no longer a barrier for children as the use of
                            local/regional vernacular has been permitted as the medium of instruction. Schools have also
                            been directed to recruit special educators to address the academic requirements of children
                            with special needs.</p>
                        <p>Cross-disability training for children with severe disabilities should also be addressed. For
                            those who cannot attend school, the home-based education system has also been incorporated
                            under the new education policy. Providing assistive devices to special needs children is
                            also another aspect that helps in providing equitable education. Standardization of Indian
                            sign language is another milestone that can help children with impaired hearing/speech.</p>
                        <p>Creating career paths for children with disabilities will definitely be one of the most
                            important steps to be undertaken as a society;</p>
                        <p>future courses of action should lay emphasis on career-based training and career development.
                            The involvement of vocational courses from the school itself is providing a way for future
                            employment opportunities. Though getting accepted into the mainstream workforce in a
                            respectable job remains a big challenge for people with special needs.</p>
                        <p>Encouraging entrepreneurship can be a game-changer if it is addressed and encouraged by the
                            government and the private sector holistically. Practical and forward-looking reforms are
                            needed to create a society, where children with special needs are lovingly allowed to grow
                            and prosper just like any other child.</p>
                        <p>Let us welcome inclusion as a way of life!</p>
