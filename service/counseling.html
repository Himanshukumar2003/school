                    <p>There are many types of children with disabilities and other requirements. Students may be
                        unable to perform in school activities, like sports or simple reading exercises, due to
                        their inherent special needs.
                    </p>
                    <div class="list-item mb-4">

                        <p>Here are just some examples of disabilities a child may have:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Anxiety disorder</li>
                            <li>Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)</li>
                            <li>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD)</li>
                            <li>Dyslexia, dyscalculia, and other learning disabilities</li>
                            <li>Hearing, visual, and other sensory impairment</li>
                            <li>Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD)</li>
                            <li>Physical disabilities</li>

                        </ul>

                    </div>
                    <p>Special students with special needs also include those with an advanced intellect. The
                        talented and special students with special needs often possess leadership, creativity,
                        communication skills, and intelligence well beyond what’s expected of their age. They often
                        feel underwhelmed by the lack of challenge in their schools.</p>
                    <p>But children with mental and physical disabilities aren’t your only kind of special students
                        with special needs. Those who are at a disadvantage or have a harder time learning because
                        their brains cannot take it are also special students who have special needs.Now, and
                        especially during the pandemic, education continues to be special and a privilege.</p>
                    <p>Special Students who have special needs need superior connectivity to the internet to join
                        classes and find resources. They should also have at least one gadget of their own to submit
                        class requirements</p>

                    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-primary mb-6">Benefits</h2>

                    <h3>Counseling for the Needs of Special Students At
                        School</h3>

                    <div className="prose prose-slate max-w-none space-y-4">
                        <p>
                            First, counseling can help in identifying special students with special needs. With their
                            background, they can pick up on actions and social cues signaling a student's difficulty
                            integrating with a group.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Students with special learning disabilities may look as if they're the same as other
                            ordinary kids. They may only begin to show signs of their disability when reading, writing,
                            or solving problems. So, while they may seem well-adjusted at first, special needs students
                            with learning disabilities who have special needs may progress slower in time.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Children with special needs who have developmental disorders like attention
                            deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) also often have difficulty processing their thoughts
                            and feelings.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Because of this, they may need specialized care. Fortunately, they can learn about and
                            develop thought processes and expressions. Counseling can help children with ADHD to learn
                            how to express themselves better.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Another example would be the children having disabilities. While their conditions aren't
                            limitations themselves, they can still hinder them from socializing in fear of being
                            different. This fear may be hard to identify, especially if a child is already very
                            reserved.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Unfortunately, special students who have special needs with advanced talents and
                            intelligence may feel undervalued. This feeling can then lead to demotivation as they
                            continue to learn for mediocre test scores. Studies also show that this demotivation may
                            result in underachieving and underdeveloped children.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Luckily, a counselor can identify these challenges in children with special needs.
                            Identifying problems may only be the first step, but it's essential in helping children with
                            special needs.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Once counselors identify which students have disabilities and which special needs they
                            require, they can start working on these limitations.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For special students having learning disabilities, counselors can help them slowly learn
                            techniques to make academic requirements bearable.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            They can also help them improve their focus and concentration. Through counseling, special
                            students can learn about their condition while adapting to their inherent limitations.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            On the other hand, counselors can also design special education programs for special
                            disabled students. During counseling, counselors can also evaluate the benefits and
                            detriments of their special education programs. Special education programs may include these
                            changes:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Assistive learning devices</li>
                            <li>Educational and psychological assessments</li>
                            <li>Classroom environment</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            Thus, students can learn the same lessons as their classmates, thanks to new teaching
                            methods that consider their limitations.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            All of this development wouldn't happen during one-on-one sessions with a counselor.
                            However, counseling can help special students feel more secure in the group.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            During such sessions, students who have special needs can improve on their social,
                            communication, and other interpersonal skills. They can also build friendships in small
                            counseling groups. Students having special needs can then rely on this newly-found
                            relationship for support, even after counseling ends.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Lastly, counseling can help students who have special needs under special education gain
                            self-acceptance. Counselors can also help these children learn more about their respective
                            condition.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            One of the hot discussions for the disabled community is the identity-first language. To
                            identify first language encourages one's aim to break any stigma or negative connotations
                            previously associated with terms such as "disabled" or "autistic." This movement thus
                            promotes the use of such terms when identifying a disabled person.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            On the other hand, some people prefer the person-first language. This movement, on the other
                            hand, seeks to recognize people first before their disabilities.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Regardless of their day-to-day in question serves to teach how they want to be referred.
                            Counseling can help children discover their strengths and weaknesses. With the proper
                            education about their limitations, children can learn to accept their condition and build an
                            identity from there.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In conclusion, counselors in the school setting do more than just talking to students in
                            detention or those who have discipline infractions. But also, counselors help the disabled,
                            marginalized, and gifted children.
