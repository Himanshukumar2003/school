                        social, and motor skills.
                        For people with autism, OT programs often focus on play skills, learning strategies, and
                        self-care.Occupational therapy helps people across the lifespan to master the skills that
                        help children develop, recover and maintain daily living skills and also to improve thinking
                        and reasoning. OT strategies can also help to manage sensory issues.</p>

                    <div class="list-item mb-4">
                        <p>The occupational therapist will begin by evaluating the person's current level of
                            ability. The evaluation looks at several areas, including how the person:
                        <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Learns</li>
                            <li>Plays</li>
                            <li>Cares for themselves</li>
                            <li>Interacts with their environment</li>

                    </div>
                    <div class="list-item">
                        <p>Based on this evaluation, the therapist creates goals and strategies that will allow the
                            person to work on key skills. Some examples of common goals include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Independent dressing</li>
                            <li>Eating</li>
                            <li>Grooming</li>
                            <li>Using the bathroom</li>
                            <li>Fine motor skills like writing, coloring, and cutting with scissors</li>
                        </ul>

                    <div>
                        <p>Occupational therapy usually involves half-hour to one-hour sessions. The number of sessions
                            per week is based on individual needs.

                        </p>
                        <p>

                            The person with autism may also practice these strategies and skills outside of therapy
                            sessions at home and in other settings including school.

                        <p>
                            Some OTs are specifically trained to address feeding and swallowing challenges in people
                            with autism. They can evaluate the particular issue a person is dealing with and provide
                            treatment plans for improving feeding-related challenges.</p>

                    <p>The occupational therapist collaborates with the student, parents, and educators to identify the
                        skills of the student, the demands of the environment, and appropriate solutions for
                        interventions. Another example is the family of a newborn baby with poor feeding skills. The
                        occupational therapist may provide training and support for the family to enhance the baby's
                        ability to drink from a bottle.</p>
                    <p>Occupational therapy practitioners provide services that enable people to organize, manage, and
                        perform their daily life occupations and activities.</p>
                    <p>Occupational therapy services support a child's participation in activities of daily living,

                        <p>Many children can benefit from getting occupational therapy. They do not need to be behind on
                            anything to benefit from this type of therapy. However, if your child is behind on any type
                            of development, they will get even greater benefits from customized occupational therapy.

                    <p>Children do not see occupational therapy as work. Instead, they see occupational therapy as games
                        to play. They get to have fun while mastering new skills. The more games they play, the more of
                        those skills they will master and the further ahead they will get. Occupational therapy covers
                        all types of skills, and allows children to get caught up, and in many instances, move ahead of
                        their peers.</p>

                    <h2>Procedure of occupational therapy</h2>
                    <p>Evaluation, Intervention, and Outcome</p>
                    <p>Many professions use the process of evaluating, intervening, and targeting intervention outcomes
                        that is outlined in the Framework. However occupational therapy's focus on occupation throughout
                        the process makes the profession's application and use of the process unique. The process of
                        occupational therapy service delivery begins by evaluating the client's occupational needs,
                        problems, and concerns.</p>
                    <p>Understanding the client as an occupational human being for whom access and participation in
                        meaningful and productive activities is central to health and well-being, is a perspective that
                        is unique to occupational therapy. Problems and concerns that are addressed in evaluation and
                        intervention are also framed uniquely from an occupational perspective, are based on
                        occupational therapy theories, and are defined as problems or risks in occupational performance.
                    </p>
                    <p>During intervention, the focus remains on occupation, and efforts are directed toward fostering
                        improved engagement in occupations. A variety of therapeutic activities, including engagement in
                        actual occupations and in daily life activities, are used in intervention.</p>
