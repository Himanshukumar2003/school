                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>Special education is the individually planned and systematically monitored arrangement of
                        teaching procedures, adapted equipment and materials, accessible settings, and other
                        interventions designed to help learners with special needs achieve a higher level of personal
                        self-sufficiency and success in school and community than would be available if the student were
                        only given access to a typical classroom education.</p>

                    <p>Special education is an additional service, support, programs, specialized placements or
                        environments to ensure that all students' educational needs are provided for.</p>

                        Why special education?</h2>
                    <p>Differentiated education is a modified form of the basic education program, meaning that the same
                        material is covered yet in a different way. Through differentiation, material is broken down in
                        line with the students’ needs depending on the difficulties the child needs to overcome in order
                        to effectively learn.</p>
                    <p>Research data show that children with disabilities spend 80% of their time in general education
                        classrooms, which means that they attend regular education. In other words, they learn the same
                        material, except that certain things are done differently. Thus, for example, potential
                        difficulties with reading or writing will be resolved through oral exams. In that sense, special
                        education should be an integral part of the basic education program with teachers trained to
                        work in an inclusive learning environment.</p>

                    <h2>Importance</h2>

                    <p>The most important mission of special education is to provide students with special needs with
                        development opportunities and a learning process that will improve the quality of their life.
                        This can only be done through the cooperation of schools and government institutions that
                        provide free appropriate education. This way, children acquire knowledge in line with their
                        unique needs and abilities, with the help of special educators and advanced classrooms.
                    <p>
                    <p>This process has a great value for society as a whole, because special-needs children get the
                        opportunity to be accepted into the community, which helps them to become more independent and
                        happier, surrounded by people who understand their needs and support them at every step of the
                        way.</p>

                    <h3>Assessment</h3>
                    <p>
                        An assessment in special education is the process used to determine a child’s specific learning
                        strengths and needs, and to determine whether or not a child is eligible for special education
                        services. Special Education support goes beyond what is normally offered or received in the
                        regular school/classroom setting. Thus, Special Education not only takes care of academic
                        education but helps in different areas of cognitive development (as described above)to improve
                        quality of life of a child. The Individualized Education Plan (IEP) for the child takes care of
                        the individual needs and education of the child in the following areas:
                    </p>
                    <div class="list-heading-text">

                        <p> <strong>Attention (awareness of others, objects, or activities):</strong>Attention goals
                            focus on sustained attention; joint attention; and shifting attention from event to event,
                            object to object, object to person, and person to object.</p>

                        <p><strong>Imitation:</strong> Imitation is an essential prerequisite skill in learning from
                            others. Imitation goals include imitation with objects, motor actions, oral motor actions,
                            vocalizations, verbalizations, gestures, academic tasks, and social skills.</p>
                        <p><strong>Communication:</strong>Communication goals focus on expressive and/or receptive
                            language and include verbal or augmented communication skills, social-communication skills,
                            and the use of functional communication systems to provide alternatives to challenging <a

                        <p><strong>Social development:</strong>: Social development is a core deficit area for
                            individuals on the autism spectrum. Goals in this area include body language, manners,
                            conversation skills, friendship management, cooperative play skills, self-regulation,
                            empathy, and conflict management, among others. </p>
                        <p><strong>Play:</strong> Developmentally appropriate and functional play skills are targeted as
                            an avenue to increase social skills with peers.</p>
                        <p><strong>Cognitive development:</strong>Cognitive goals include a focus on conceptual
                            development, problem-solving, academic performance, and executive functions (i.e. flexible,
                            strategic plan of action to solve a problem or attain a future goal).</p>
                        <p><strong>Challenging behaviours: </strong> The function of challenging behaviours are
                            identified and appropriate alternative behaviours are taught using positive behaviour
                            supports.</p>

                        <p><strong>Sensory and motor development:</strong>Individual differences in motor and sensory
                            functioning are identified and planned for, including tactile/touch, visual, smell, sound,
                            and taste; environmental stressors are identified and modified.</p>
                        <p><strong>Adaptive behaviour:</strong> Essential life skills, including hygiene, self-help and
                            safety are considered and planned for in order to enhance personal independence and create
                            opportunities for greater community participation, including independent living, working and
                            recreating.</p>
                        <p><strong>Recreation/Leisure/Physical Education:</strong>Recreation skills are important goals
                            as they enhance cognitive, social and motor skills; enhance relationships between self and
                            environment; shape appropriate use of unstructured time; increase opportunities to get
                            physical exercise and stay healthy; and increase enjoyment of life.</p>
