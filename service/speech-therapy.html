                        with autism improve their verbal, nonverbal, and social communication. The overall goal is to
                        help the person communicate in more useful and functional ways.</p>

                        assess the person’s communication strengths and challenges. From this evaluation, the SLP
                        creates individual goals for therapy.</p>

                    <h2>Why speech therapy at Adhyayan?</h2>
                    <p>Children are treated for different speech disorders, stuttering, problems pronouncing words,
                        trouble with pitch, volume or quality of speech, and having a limited understanding of words and
                        their meaning. Some children have problems putting words together or use language in an
                        inappropriate way. Others have memory and attention disorders. Some children have problems
                        swallowing, chewing, coughing and refusing food. Additionally, speech therapy may be necessary
                        for a child who has experienced speech impairment due to an illness or injury. There are a
                        variety of reasons why a child may need speech therapy. If you notice that your child is not on
                        par with their peers or developmental milestones for their age, ongoing or intensive speech
                        therapy sessions may be beneficial to your child.
                    </p>
                    <p>The speech language therapists at Adhyayan specialize in a variety of methods to address the
                        communication needs of students exhibiting various disorders and/or syndromes which include
                        autism spectrum disorders, Down Syndrome, Rett Syndrome, cerebral palsy, William’s Syndrome,
                        Angelman Syndrome, developmental disabilities, and other rare genetic syndromes. They have been
                        trained to deliver services to address all areas of speech and language including receptive
                        language, auditory processing, expressive language, pragmatic language and social communication,
                        articulation, voice, and fluency disorders as well as dysphagia, oral motor, and feeding needs.

                        <p>
                            Providing children without a voice a way to communicate through unaided and/or aided
                            communication (e.g. no tech communication books, low and mid tech communication devices,
                            high tech communication devices and/or communication apps). Speech and language therapy is
                            not just about speech; it also includes language. Many people have a misconception that
                            speech therapy is just about the speech but it is so much more than that.

                        <p>
                            Appropriate pragmatic/social skills are a key component to interacting with others in their
                            community and life. When you have limited, or have no functional speech, pragmatic language
                            skills are often significantly delayed and disordered. Social skills can be targeted with
                            the use of video modeling, role playing, specific therapy apps, social stories and other
                            various strategies and tools. The use of aided communication with these strategies to work
                            on improving these social skills is an important aspect of speech therapy.

                            Speech delay can cause problems listening, reading and writing. Reading and literacy skills
                            can significantly aid in communication. When you can spell, you can communicate freely.
                            Teaching these essential skills can be the key to better communication with others.

                            communication (e.g. use the sign for “bathroom”, “eat” and “drink”, tap on a person’s
                            shoulder to get their attention, etc). Also, if a child has specific sounds that are being
                            used consistently, make them meaningful. For example, if a child can say “ha,” use that for
                            “help”. For the approximation, “ba” you might use that for “book” if that is important to

                            Speech therapy helps children improve communication skills with other children and adults.
                            It focuses on improving speech muscles through special exercises. Speech exercises involve
                            repeating sounds and imitating the speech therapist.

                        <p>Kids might need speech-language therapy for many reasons, including:</p>
                        <ul>

                            <li>weak oral muscles</li>
                            <li>chronic hoarseness</li>
                            <li>cleft lip or cleft palate</li>
                            <li>autism</li>
                            <li>motor planning problems</li>
                            <li>articulation problems</li>

                        <p>Therapy should begin as soon as possible. Children who start therapy early (before they're 5
                            years old) tend to have better results than those who begin later.</p>
                        <p>This doesn't mean that older kids won't do well in therapy. Their progress might be slower,
                            though, because they have learned patterns that need to be changed.</p>
